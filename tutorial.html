        <h3> Step 1: Preparing your object</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a model of your object</li>
          <li>Make an appointment with Dominican's Media Center to download previously created objects.</li>
          <li>2 hour blocks designated for appointments</li>
          <li> Create objects of your selection and save as .STL or .OBJ files</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Specifications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Models created in the Media Center can be printed immedialtely when time allots. If students or faculty are unable to print, files will be saved
             on Media Center computers as soon as possible. Email confirmations will be sent when objects are ready for pickup.</li>
          <li>All printing requests must be sent to mediacenter@dom.edu</li>
