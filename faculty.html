        <h3> Step 1: Preparing your object</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a model of your object</li>
          <li>Make an appointment with Dominican's Media Center to download previously created objects.</li>
          <li>2 hour blocks designated for appointments</li>
          <li> Create objects of your selection and save as .STL or .OBJ files</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> If Student or faculty member has saved or printed object, and is unable to print immediately, items should be saved
            on their own computer.</li>
          <li>All printing requests must be sent to mediacenter@dom.edu</li>
          <li>Please allow five days for processing</li>
          <li>Dominican's Media Center specifies 3D objects "must not exceeed 9 inches across, 6 inches deep, and 5.7 inches
            tall"
          </li>
        </ul>
